# Code of Conduct

We expect all contributors to agree to our [Working Agreements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KyngJ8K7FMUlic2G3OonZEBwoTH85hWO88oX-38URKM/edit?usp=sharing). 

In short, what this looks like in practice is that we expect contributors to be considerate, respectful, and collaborative. We will not tolerate bullying or harassment.

Please refer to our Community Moderation Guide (accessible to onboarded PEDP members) for processes related to reporting and resolving violations of our working agreements.
