# Overview

Welcome! This repo contains information and resources about Public Environmental Data Partners' Github use and open source practices to help people get involved in our work.

## Mission


## How We Work

This project is a collaborative endeavor. We respect one another and embrace a culture of learning and of gratitude. We are non-hierarchical. We share the responsibilities and workload of the project, and we share credit for the work that is accomplished. As a project team, we explicitly support science, data and information integrity, public access, democracy, and civic engagement. 

We use Github and Github Projects to manage our open source software development and archiving. 

We expect contributors to review and abide by our Code of Conduct and Contributor Guidelines.


## Getting Started


*New to PEDP?* Visit our [Get Involved page](https://screening-tools.com/get-involved) to read our organizational Working Agreements, privacy guidance, and fill out our volunteer interest form. Once you've filled out the form, we will be in touch with next steps for orientation and onboarding to our communication tools. 

While onboarding to our chat may make communication about projects easier, you *do not* need to fill out the volunteer form to contribute to our open source projects. Feel free to check out our [repos](https://github.com/orgs/Public-Environmental-Data-Partners/repositories) and browse [good first issues](https://github.com/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Agood-first-issue+user%3APublic-Environmental-Data-Partners) to get started!


For everyone, please refer the guidelines below for creating repositories and working on Github.


### Creating a Github repo
There are three typical scenarios for PEDP project repos on Github: [Archiving an existing project from another source](), [building on an existing archived (or forked) project](), and [creating a new project containing original sourcecode]().


#### Archiving an external project


#### Building on an archived project


#### Creating an original project



### License
[AGPLv3](LICENSE) is our preferred license for code.

### Issue templates
We recommend using issue templates for Github repos to make consistent, thorough issue creation easier. Our [template repo](https://github.com/Public-Environmental-Data-Partners/template) contains suggested [issue templates](https://github.com/Public-Environmental-Data-Partners/template/tree/main/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE, including Spanish versions.

### Github access policy



## Funding

*Our work is made possible through volunteer labor, grants, and tax-deductible donations from the public.*
